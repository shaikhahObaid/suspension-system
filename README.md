# robot suspension system
 AT the first of all what is a suspension system?

A suspension system is a set of mechanical connections, springs, and dampers that connect the wheels to the chassis. It has traditionally performed two functions: managing the baseâ€™s handling and braking for safety the robot from bumps, vibrations, and other factors.

#### Types of suspension system 
Suspension systems can be divided into two main groups: independent suspension and connected suspension
As for the independent suspension systems, the wheel in it is not affected by the vertical movement of the opposite wheel
A prime example is the McPherson strut
  As it is characterized by a simple design and light weight, it also takes up little space ,so it is used in the base of robots
